# TODO.md

A simple task tracking file so I can keep track of what I'm working on.

## TO DOs
* jim.r.smiley@gmail.com should be entered when starting up
* create a foreign key constraint on user_polygon and the updated np_up table so you can't delete them that easily
* log more activity in controllers, like whathood requests, search usage
* build test points into proper objects in TestPointMapper
* document the test point console route
* move WatcherController into Restful dir
* whathood click isn't working
