# TODO.md

A simple task tracking file so I can keep track of what I'm working on.

## TO DOs
* ~~allow watch controller to pull by one neighborhood name~~
* TEST THIS IS FASTER: in creating sql point grid, don't query whether the point is in the supplied polygon, since it will get queried again later.
