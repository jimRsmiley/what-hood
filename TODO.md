# TODO.md

A simple task tracking file so I can keep track of what I'm working on.

## TO DOs
* have watcher controller email a report of what it does when it finds polygons to add
* jim.r.smiley@gmail.com should be entered when starting up
* export the current test database to the github db backup, be able to import it to a new vagrant setup
* create a foreign key constraint on user_polygon and the updated np_up table so you can't delete them that easily
* fix the search bar in the upper right
