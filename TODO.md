# TODO.md

A simple task tracking file so I can keep track of what I'm working on.

## TO DOs
* ~~TEST THIS IS FASTER: in creating sql point grid, don't query whether the point is in the supplied polygon, since it will get queried again later. DIDN"T WORK~~
* have watcher controller email a report of what it does when it finds polygons to add
* jim.r.smiley@gmail.com should be entered when starting up
* export the current test database to the github db backup, be able to import it to a new vagrant setup
* ~~whathood-user-polygon-page list page 2 doesn't work~~
* re-set up a 'whathood' click'
