What Hood Is This?
=======================

Crowdsourcing neighborhood borders

[http://whathood.in](http://whathood.in)

Whathood aims to settle the neighborhood border debate for all time by aggregating
neighborhood borders drawn by users into heatmaps showing the "identity" of a
location.

### Goals

* Get Google, Foursquare, Yelp, and real estate sites to use published shapefiles
